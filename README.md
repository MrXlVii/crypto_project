# crytography-project

A repo to practice cryptography and cryptanalysis and to build skills to turn into a side project.

Projects:

    1. Caesar cipher
        - Primarily this is a program that encrypts and decrypts the caesar cipher which is a basic shift cipher.
        - Prompts the user for the appropriate input, then outputs the shifted ciphertext. 
        - Considered making the program loop until user exits, but it was more practice than anything else
        - Unit test is testCaesar.py
        
    2. Enigma Machine [work in progress]
        - OOP working model of the Engima machine used in WW2.
        - Plan to make it the three rotor encryption scheme, [link for blueprints to come]
